    <h3>Some facts about me</h3>
    <hr>
    <ul id="tribute-info">
      <li>I am currently learning how to code and just a week before I found Freecodecamp and this website is amazing.</li>
      
      <li>For now I only know the HTML, CSS, and Javascript basic knowledge and I haven't learned how to use it yet.</li>
      
      <li>This code took me 2 hours to finish and another 2 hours to perfect it</li>
      
      <li>My career paths is about computer related, like software engineer, data analyst, etc.</li>
      
      <li>The name Excardical is just a made up name by me. I use this name as my in game name, username, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>This is my first project and it's sucks but soon I'll be a programmer that I desire. <br><br>
